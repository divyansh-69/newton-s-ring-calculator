The Physics Practical Online Calculator Website is a valuable educational tool  designed to assist students in performing calculations quickly and accurately for their physics practical experiments. By leveraging
the power of technology, this website aims to
streamline the process of solving physicsrelated numerical problems, allowing
students to focus more on the concepts and
principles behind the experiments rather
than spending excessive time on manual
calculations.

This online calculator is based on a 1st year Physics
experinment called Newtonian rings experiment.This
calculator will help us calculate the Radius of curvature of
the lens.
Newton's Rings are formed by interference between thin
films of uniformly increasing thickness on either side of a
bright or dark central circle
