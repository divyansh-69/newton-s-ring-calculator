## 🧪 About the Project  

This online calculator is based on a **First-Year Physics Laboratory Experiment** — the **Newton’s Rings Experiment**.  
It helps users **calculate the Radius of Curvature of a Lens** using measured data of ring diameters and fringe order.  

**Newton’s Rings** are formed due to **interference of light** between the top surface of a glass plate and the lower surface of a convex lens placed on it.  
As the thickness of the air film increases radially, concentric bright and dark fringes (rings) appear — and this calculator visualizes and computes parameters based on that optical principle.

## 📘 Formula Used  

For Newton’s Rings experiment,  
\[
R = \frac{D_n^2 - D_{n-1}^2}{4n\lambda}
\]  

Where:  
- \( R \) = Radius of curvature of the lens  
- \( D_n \) = Diameter of the nth ring  
- \( D_{n-1} \) = Diameter of the (n-1)th ring  
- \( \lambda \) = Wavelength of light used  
- \( n \) = Fringe order  

This calculator implements the above formula programmatically, reducing calculation time and improving accuracy.
